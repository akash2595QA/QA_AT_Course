1)mvn clean
--> It deletes the target folder from inside the project.

2)mvn compile
-->It complies(converts it to .class file) the .java from src/main/java and stores it in target/classes folder.

3)mvn test
-->It complies(converts it to .class file) the .java from src/test/java and stores it in target/test-classes folder.

4) mvn compile test
-->It complies(converts it to .class file) the .java from src/test/java and src/test/java both and stores it in target/test-classes folder
and also runs the tests mentiond inside surefire plugin in pom.xml file.

5)mvn package or mvn clean compile test paackage
--> It repeats step 4 and further creates a build/jar file inside target folder that we can run on any machine.

6)mvn install
--> apart from repating step 5 and creating jar file inside target folder it also creates jar file inside mvn repository which is in C:\Users\07psycho\.m2\repository(here all the dependencies are downloaded).
